At the beginning of my high school career, I was very apathetic towards life and feelings. I was not shaken by traumatic events or the seriousness of life and I lived very selfishly. However, the past year I have started becoming more aware of the seriousness of our world and began to have feelings. At the end of Summer 2018, one of my friends was found dead at the bottom of a cliff in Washington state while hiking. This was tough to deal with especially since this was someone I grew up with and I realized death was inevitable and can sneak up on you anytime. I started worrying if what I was doing was worthwhile for a future worth living and that scared me. Also beginning this year, my grandpa started to lose his memory exponentially more than previously and became abusive. This is something hard to watch my mom take care of him every day after a long day at work because no one else wants to take care of him because he’s crazy and abusive. It’s emotionally draining to watch my mom get beat trying to take care of her father and watching my grandpa beat his wife. Where is the line drawn when you have to stop taking care of someone you love for the welfare of society?

At the end of freshman year when I was scheduling classes for sophomore year, the counselor told me that I could not take English 10 H because I was enrolling in too many honors classes after a freshman year of just regular classes. This was really difficult to sink in because I didn’t know how to react to authority telling me no even though I knew that this was not what was supposed to happen. I was thoroughly pissed because even though I wasn’t the best at english, I really wanted to grow in my skills and study in a more intense atmosphere. This situation made me very vulnerable because if I were to stand up for myself, this might have led to some problems in the future with letters of recommendations but after standing up for myself it helped with confidence in myself. Even though someone with authority told me no, when I questioned them because I knew what was right, it wasn’t difficult to overcome their decision.

The biggest inaction I have going on right now is my unwillingness to dedicate time for college applications. I know that if put in the work necessary now, I will have such a better time come March when admissions decisions come out. However, my laziness and inability to comprehend where I go for the next four years is an important decision is stunting my reflection and writing in college apps. Instead of breaking things off with my ex who is in college so I can fully enjoy my circumstance in Arcadia, I am stringing her along with me on a strand of rope. This inaction is hurting me because I am not able to put myself out there completely to make new friends and rekindle relationships I have had in the past. It is also putting me in a state of disillusionment in how I am leading myself on false pretenses like that this relationship will work or that I am happier in my relationship than without one.

My best friend is Will Zhu, a previous student of Mr. Delfin. We have very similar goals in life but at the same time a lot of varying views and perspectives. One of the many reasons why we’re best friends is because we can voice our views and thoughts without fear of backlash for not being PC or having an unpopular view. If I were to die today, Will would say I was a very independent person who has shaped my views and actions not by the weight of society but rather from my own experiences and background that has made me uniquely me. I think he would say that because we have built our friendship on our openness with each other and our understanding that we aren’t following society but ourselves. This is evident in our unpopular opinions in a very blue state and having different motivations than a very tiger-parent community.

If I were to die tomorrow, I would honestly be scared about what they say about me. I have been reserved with my family about what I do and how I feel. To my immediate family, they would probably say that I was a gifted person who was mean to his family and distant. This is because I spend my time either at school, work or in my room. I refuse to spend time with my family because of my short temper and different way of thinking than them which is something I might regret in the future. My dad would probably say that I was like him, in his thinking, what he likes to do, and how he acts(but I’m a lot meaner). We both grew up very meta and understanding of what our circumstances are and we both attempt to grow in ourselves. My mom would say that I was so different than anyone else in the family. How I show my love to the family is not direct but rather indirect in what I do and many times goes unnoticed like picking up the check for dinner or making calls to arrange appointments or buying groceries when everyone is super busy. She would say I’m the talented one in the family, not having to overextend myself to learn concepts like my brother and sister have to do, and that I have just started blooming. My sister would say that I had such a bright future evident in my ideas, my businesses, my aspirations, and my love for curiosity. So if someone asked my entire family at once about my legacy, they would say I was different, but going one by one each individual would say something special.

“He never killed a man that did not need killing”
Fuck. As a supporter of the armed forces and the second ammendment, this one hits hard but I don’t know why. I could argue that this supports the argument that guns can be good, but this is so much deeper than that. I think that this epitaph resonates with me because given free will and access to a dangerous weapon capable of killing anyone, this man chose to do the right thing. I also respect how this man did what many people are not capable of doing and committing to doing those things, unlike Hamlet.
<br>“Free at last.  Free at last.
<br>Thank God Almighty
<br>I’m Free at last.”<br>
This is MLK’s epitaph. This resonates with me because he fought his entire life for the rights and freedom for his race which is crazy. Through this fight, he landed in jail, persecuted everywhere he went, and ran through hell. His life was hell. And dying set him free from the hell he was trying to fix into heaven where he would thrive. This is something I think about sometimes, school being my hell, trying to go to college to be set free from this living hell. When I want to be free but I’m being set back by my circumstances, I just want to scream. And be set free, to be free at last.

“Great Ideas, Unorthodox Thinker”<br>
I am not the stereotypical smart Asian pushed by his parents. My motivation is not forced by somebody breathing on the back of my neck, but from my struggles and experiences that I’ve seen and I want to be remembered for being different. I grew up not being able to speak and fuck was that difficult. However, not being able to speak let me spend all my time in my mind, thinking. Thinking and creating hypotheticals are my shit. And through this, I have formulated in my humble opinion some pretty crazy ideas from how to run an online business with absolutely no prior business knowledge to a foolproof way to sneak out of my house. And through the time spent in my head instead of collaborating with others has differentiated my way of thinking to others. When I’m doing math, I use words instead of numbers when I’m calculating something. When I turn in an English assignment or project, they tend to be a lot different than others (and sometimes wrong) because I’m not used to approaching questions or projects as other people do. So I feel like I am very unorthodox in my thinking and that has helped me a lot when collaborating because I bring an unique POV to the minds of normies.
