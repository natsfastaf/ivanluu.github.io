At the beginning of my high school career, I was very apathetic towards life and feelings. I was not shaken by traumatic events or the seriousness of life and I lived very selfishly. However, the past year I have started becoming more aware of the seriousness of our world and began to have feelings. At the end of Summer 2018, one of my friends was found dead at the bottom of a cliff in Washington state while hiking. This was tough to deal with especially since this was someone I grew up with and I realized death was inevitable and can sneak up on you anytime. I started worrying if what I was doing was worthwhile for a future worth living and that scared me. Also beginning this year, my grandpa started to lose his memory exponentially more than previously and became abusive. This is something hard to watch my mom take care of him every day after a long day at work because no one else wants to take care of him because he’s crazy and abusive. It’s emotionally draining to watch my mom get beat trying to take care of her father and watching my grandpa beat his wife. Where is the line drawn when you have to stop taking care of someone you love for the welfare of society?
