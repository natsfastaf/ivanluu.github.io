Kelly Liang,<br>
If you're reading this, you're probably really bored or I gave you the URL. Words cannot describe what I'm feeling for you right now.<br>
There's this underlying feeling of butterflies everytime I see, talk or think about you. However, there's also a feeling of anger, sadness<br>
and confusion. I want to know you, but it's so hard to. We're so different it gets me mad that I have feelings for you. You're a senior, I'm a junior.<br>
Your friends don't talk to mine and your siblings don't like me. We don't have anything in common and are both ambiguous when making decisions.<br>
I don't know anything about you and when I try to know you better, I don't know how to.  <br>
<br>
Do I like you?<br>
<br>
I don't know, I think so.<br>
<br>
What are these feelings?<br>
<br>
I don't know.<br>
<br>
How can things change?<br>
<br>
I don't know.<br>
<br>
But, I think we should<br>
<br>
Give it a chance,<br>
I.L.

I love you
